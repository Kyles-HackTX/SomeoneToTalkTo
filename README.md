# SomeoneToTalkTo
This app identifies emotion in voices using machine learning. Specifically, we use a convulutional neural network with rectified neural networks.

In this demo, the user presses a button, and speaks into a microphone to get a guessed emotion from the machine.

This could be used for customer service for detecting customer satisfaction without a survey.
